# AudioPlayerApi

**AudioPlayerApi** is a dependency for plugins that provides advanced capabilities for managing and playing audio clips, complete with support for spatial audio and multiple speakers. This plugin is designed for use in SCP: SL Dedicated servers.

---

## Features

- Create, manage, and play multiple audio clips.
- Spatial audio support for immersive sound experiences.
- Add multiple speakers with individual configurations.
- Seamless integration with game events and player-specific audio setups.

---

# Audio requirements

- Format .ogg
- Channels: 1 ( MONO )
- Freq: 48Khz

---

## Installation

1. Download latest [dependencies.zip](https://github.com/Killers0992/AudioPlayer/releases/latest/download/dependencies.zip) from ``Releases``.
2. Extract all files and put in your dependencies folder. ( this path may be different depending on which plugin framework you use )

---

## Usage

**AudioPlayer** can be only used as ``plugin`` dependency which means its not a plugin rather API for other plugins to use.

If you want to play something you need to follow these steps.

1. Load supported audio clip.

2. Create audio player.

3. Add clip to audio player.

``Example code for doing this can be found below.``

## Examples

<details>
<summary>
1. Loading audio clips
</summary>

```C#
// This method should be called when plugin loads.
public void OnPluginLoad()
{
    // Specify path for your ogg file and name it, this name will be used later for adding clips to audio players.
    //
    //  Make sure that ogg file is MONO and frequency is 48Khz 
    //
    AudioClipStorage.LoadClip("C:\\Users\\Kille\\Documents\\Serwer\\com.ogg", "shot");
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Audio player attached to players.</summary>

```C#
// Creating audio player which is attached to player which means any added clip to this audio player will be directly at player position.
public void CreateForPlayer(Player player)
{
    AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer.CreateOrGet($"Player {player.Nickname}", onIntialCreation: (p) =>
    {        
        // Attach created audio player to player.
        p.transform.parent = player.GameObject.transform;

        // This created speaker will be in 3D space.
        Speaker speaker = p.AddSpeaker("Main", isSpatial: true, minDistance: 5f, maxDistance: 15f);

        // Attach created speaker to player.
        speaker.transform.parent = player.GameObject.transform;

        // Set local positino to zero to make sure that speaker is in player.
        speaker.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;
    });

    // As example we will add clip
    audioPlayer.AddClip("shot");
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Global audio players.</summary>

```C#
// Creates global audio player which everyone can hear from any location.
public void CreateGlobal()
{
    AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer.CreateOrGet($"Global AudioPlayer", onIntialCreation: (p) =>
    {
        // This created speaker will be in 2D space ( audio will be always playing directly on you not from specific location ) but make sure that max distance is set to some higher value.
        Speaker speaker = p.AddSpeaker("Main", isSpatial: false, maxDistance: 5000f);
    });

    audioPlayer.AddClip("shot");
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Spectator only audio player</summary>

```C#
// Creates audio player which only spectators can hear.
public void CreateSpectatorOnly()
{
    AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer.CreateOrGet($"Spectator AudioPlayer", condition: (hub) =>
    {
        // Only players which have spectator role will hear this sound.
        return hub.roleManager.CurrentRole.RoleTypeId == PlayerRoles.RoleTypeId.Spectator;
    }
    , onIntialCreation: (p) =>
    {
        // This created speaker will be in 2D space ( audio will be always playing directly on you not from specific location ) but make sure that max distance is set to some higher value.
        Speaker speaker = p.AddSpeaker("Main", isSpatial: false, maxDistance: 5000f);
    });

    audioPlayer.AddClip("shot");
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Adding clips to audio players.</summary>

```C#
// Adding clips to audio players by using their name.
public void AddClipOnAudioPlayer()
{
    // Tries to get audio player with name "Spectator AudioPlayer", you need to make sure that audio player is already created.
    if (!AudioPlayer.TryGet("Spectator AudioPlayer", out AudioPlayer audioPlayer))
        return;

    // Add shot clip and plays.
    audioPlayer.AddClip("shot");
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Lobby music.</summary>

```C#
// Execute this method when plugin loads.
public void OnPluginLoad()
{
    AudioClipStorage.LoadClip("C:\\Users\\Kille\\Documents\\Serwer\\lobby_music.ogg", "lobby_music");
}

// Execute this method via events when server is waiting for players.
public void OnWaitingForPlayers()
{
    AudioPlayer lobbyPlayer = AudioPlayer.CreateOrGet("Lobby", onIntialCreation: (p) =>
    {
        p.AddSpeaker("Main", isSpatial: false, maxDistance: 5000f);
    });

    lobbyPlayer.AddClip("lobby_music", loop: true);
}

// Execute this method via events when server started round.
public void OnRoundStart()
{
    if (!AudioPlayer.TryGet("Lobby", out AudioPlayer lobbyPlayer))
        return;

    // Removes all playing clips.
    lobbyPlayer.RemoveAllClips();
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Remove clips by their name.</summary>

```C#
public void RemoveClipInMyAudioPlayer()
{
    // Replace MyAudioPlayer with name of your audioPlayer.
    if (!AudioPlayer.TryGet("MyAudioPlayer", out AudioPlayer player))
        return;

    player.RemoveClipByName("shot");
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Remove clips by their id.</summary>

```C#
int lobbyClipId = 0;

// Execute this method via events when server is waiting for players.
public void OnWaitingForPlayers()
{
    AudioPlayer lobbyPlayer = AudioPlayer.CreateOrGet("Lobby", onIntialCreation: (p) =>
    {
        p.AddSpeaker("Main", isSpatial: false, maxDistance: 5000f);
    });

    AudioClipPlayback playback = lobbyPlayer.AddClip("lobby_music", loop: true);
    lobbyClipId = playback.Id;
}

// Execute this later...
public void RemoveClipInLobby()
